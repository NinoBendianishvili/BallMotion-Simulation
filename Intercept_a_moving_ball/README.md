# Intercept a Moving Ball Project Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a complete workflow for detecting, analyzing, and animating the motion of balls in a 2D environment. The system has three main components:

1. **Ball Detection** using `BallDetector` to detect a thrown ball and reconstruct its trajectory.
2. **Ball Throw Simulation** using `BallThrower` to simulate a throw aimed at hitting the previously detected ball.
3. **Visualization & Animation** using `Animator` to display the observed and simulated trajectories.

## 1. Ball Detection (`BallDetector`)

### Objective
Extracts the trajectory of a ball from a video by:
- Detecting the ball's position frame-by-frame.
- Estimating the ball's initial velocity and drag coefficient `(k/m)` using optimization methods.

### Key Methods

- **`_process_video()`**: Processes each video frame, detects the ball using contour analysis, and records its trajectory in meters (1 meter = 100 pixels).
- **`detect_ball()`**: Uses frame differencing and thresholding with OpenCV (`cv2`) functions like Gaussian blur, thresholding, and `findContours`.
- **`gradient_descent_initial_velocity()`**: Computes the ball's initial velocity `(v_x, v_y)` using gradient descent:
  
  $$ v_x(k+1) = v_x(k) - \eta \frac{\partial E}{\partial v_x} $$
  $$ v_y(k+1) = v_y(k) - \eta \frac{\partial E}{\partial v_y} $$
  
  - Initial velocity: `(0,0)`
  - Step size: `dt = 0.01`
  - Learning rate: `0.01`
  - Maximum iterations: `1000`
  - Error function:
    
    $$ E = \sum ((x_{obs} - x_{sim})^2 + (y_{obs} - y_{sim})^2) $$
  
- **`shooting_method()`**: Refines the drag coefficient `(k/m)` by aligning the final simulated trajectory point with the observed one.
  - Initial guess: `0.1`
  - Step size: `0.05`
  - Error threshold: `0.001`
- **`estimate_trajectory()`**: Simulates the ball's trajectory using numerical integration (RK4) to solve the motion equations.

### Mathematical Models

#### Ball Motion ODE

$$ \frac{dv_x}{dt} = - \left(\frac{k}{m} \right) v_x \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} $$
$$ \frac{dv_y}{dt} = -g - \left(\frac{k}{m} \right) v_y \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} $$

#### Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) Integration

$$ y_1 = y_0 + \frac{1}{6} (k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) $$

where:

$$ k_1 = hf(x_0, y_0) $$
$$ k_2 = hf(x_0 + \frac{1}{2}h, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}k_1) $$
$$ k_3 = hf(x_0 + \frac{1}{2}h, y_0 + \frac{1}{2}k_2) $$
$$ k_4 = hf(x_0 + h, y_0 + k_3) $$

The Runge-Kutta 4th-order method (RK4) used in the code is not A-stable. It is conditionally stable, meaning that its stability depends on the step size h. If h is too large for a given problem, particularly for stiff equations, RK4 may become unstable. But as h=0.01, relatively small step size for this problem, RK4 can guarantee stability of the process. 

#### Outputs
- **Observed Trajectory**: A sequence of `(t, x, y)` points.
- **Estimated Trajectory**: A refined sequence matching the observed motion.

## 2. Ball Throw Simulation (`BallThrower`)

### Objective
Simulates a ball throw to hit a specific target point extracted from the observed trajectory.

### Key Methods

- **`_select_target_point()`**: Randomly selects a target from the second half of the observed trajectory for better visualization.
- **`_calculate_velocity()`**: Determines initial velocity `(v_x, v_y)` needed to reach the target using iterative refinement:
  
  - `dt = 0.01`
  - Assumed `k/m = 0.01`
  - Error calculation:

$$
E_x = x_{target} - x_{end}  
E_y = y_{target} - y_{end}
$$

  
  - Velocity update (100 iterations, error threshold `0.01`):
    
$$
v_x += 0.1 \frac{E_x}{t_{target}}  
v_y += 0.1 \frac{E_y}{t_{target}}
$$
  

- **`_estimate_trajectory()`**: Computes the simulated trajectory using RK4 integration.

## Outputs

1. **Simulated Throw Trajectory**: A sequence of \((t, x, y)\) points for the ballâ€™s motion toward the target point.

2. **Initial Velocity**: Components \( v_x \) and \( v_y \) of the thrown ball.

3. **Target Point**: The chosen goal coordinates \((x, y)\) to be hit by the ball.

### Example 1:
- **Target Point**: (1.0800000000000007, 3.104110757167739, 2.0603780941512024)
- **Initial Velocity**: \( v_x = 2.96 \), \( v_y = 7.33 \)

## 3. Animation (`Animator`)

### Functionality
Visualizes the observed and simulated trajectories and compares them in an animated plot.

### Key Methods

- **`init_animation()`**: Sets axis limits, gridlines, and initializes the animation.
- **`update(frame)`**: Updates the positions of the observed and thrown balls per frame.
- **`animate()`**: Generates a frame-by-frame animation of the observed and simulated motions.

### Outputs
- **`Animation`**: A dynamic visualization showing the trajectories of the observed and simulated balls and their alignment with the target point. Animations are stored in Task2/outputs folder. To run code for personal tests one should run animator class and change value of video_path variable
