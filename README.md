# Ball Trajectory Simulation Projects

## Overview
This repository contains two interconnected projects focusing on ball trajectory analysis and simulation:

1. **Intercept a Moving Ball**: Detects, analyzes, and simulates the trajectory of a moving ball to intercept it.
2. **Hit a Ball to a Fixed Target**: Simulates a ball throw designed to precisely hit a fixed target.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV (`cv2`)
- **Numerical Computing**: NumPy, SciPy
- **Optimization & Machine Learning**: Gradient Descent, RK4 Integration
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Animations

## Detailed Documentation
Each project has its own dedicated documentation. Refer to the **README files** in the respective project folders for in-depth details and implementation specifics.
